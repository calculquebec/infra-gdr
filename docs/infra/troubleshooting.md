# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with deploying the research data management services, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

## Verify Input Variables

If you are experiencing issues with deploying the services, it may be because of incorrectly defined input variables. Ensure that all the required input variables have been correctly defined in `variables.tf`. Review the documentation for each input variable and verify that the values provided for them are correct.

## Check Provider Versions

Terraform providers have their own versioning and compatibility requirements. Ensure that the required provider versions have been correctly defined in `providers.tf` and `versions.tf`. You can check the documentation for each provider to verify the specific versions required.

## Verify Infrastructure Resources

If the input variables and provider versions have been correctly defined, the next step is to verify that the required infrastructure resources have been correctly defined in `apps.tf`, `databases.tf`, and `firewall.tf`. Check each resource definition and ensure that the configuration is correct.

## Check Logs and Error Messages

If you are still experiencing issues after trying the above troubleshooting steps, check the logs and error messages for any specific issues or errors that need to be addressed. You can use the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands with the `-debug` flag to get more detailed logging information.

If you are unable to resolve the issues after reviewing the logs and error messages, consult the Terraform documentation or seek help from the Terraform community forums.
