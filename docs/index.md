## Installation

For installation instructions, please refer to the {doc}`installation <intro/installing>` section of the documentation. This section provides detailed steps to set up and configure the software for your environment. In case you run into any issues during installation, our {doc}`troubleshooting <infra/troubleshooting>` section might come in handy.

## Documentation

The documentation for this project is built using [Sphinx][#sphinx], a popular tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.

The documentation source files can be found in the `docs` directory.

````{admonition} Create a virtual environment
:class: tip

We recommend using a virtual environment for installing required dependencies to be able to generate the documentation

```shell    
python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```
```` 

To build the documentation, simply run the follwing command:

```shell
sphinx-build docs public
```

This will generate the HTML documentation files in the `public` directory.

```{admonition} Expose the documentation
:class: tip
Use `python3 -m http.server -d public` to expose your freshly built documentation on http://0.0.0.0:8000 
```
