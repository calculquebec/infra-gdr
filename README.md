## Documentation

Our [ðŸ“š documentation][#documentation] provides detailed steps to set up and configure the software for your environment.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery 

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is used to manage terraform state files.

When a **merge request** is created, the pipeline is triggered, which includes formatting and validating the code.

Parallelized `build` jobs are then run to *plan* the infrastructure using terraform for any specified **TF_STATE_NAMES**.

If planning succeeds, the `deploy` and `destroy` jobs can be manually executed. These jobs require access to the repository as a Developer or higher.
